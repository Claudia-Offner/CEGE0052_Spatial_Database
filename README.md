# CEGE0052_Zoo_Database

The assignment involves the selection of an asset management topic of choice for which a hierarchical pyramid was created to show how the features (assets) and decisions based on information about those features nest upwards. The pyramid has at least 3 levels of spatial nesting from which a list of 7 asset-management decisions are created. Two of the decisions use data from lower level decisions (i.e. bottom-> middle and middle -> top). The SQL code creates a physical database for a hypothetical Zoo, inserts data and uses queries to demonstrate how this data can be used as evidence for the decisions.
